Dependency grammar to LTIG:

- a dependency tree corresponds to a LTIG derivation, where
	- in case of single word anchors, each word corresponds to a the lexical anchor of a (hidden) LTIG tree
	- in case of MWL anchors a subtree of words corresponds to a single label of a lexical anchor
		- we have a further restriction viz. that the words a chains of words
	- and each edge corresponds to the (hidden) LTIG operation that has been applied
